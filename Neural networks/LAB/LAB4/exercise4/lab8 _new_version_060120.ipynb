    "# 8 Convolutional neural networks\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to learn the basic stuff about [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN or ConvNet). In the previous exercises the building blocks mostly included simple operations that had some kind of activations functions and the each layer was usually fully connected to the previous one. CNNs take into account the spatial nature of the input data, e.g. an image, and they process it by applying one or more  [kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28image_processing%29). In the case of images, this processing i.e. convolving is also known as filtering. The results of processing the input with a single kernel will be a signle channel, but usually a convolutional layer involves more kernels that then produce more channels. These channels are often called **feature maps** because each kernel is specialized for extraction of a certain kind of features from the input. These feature maps are then combined into a single tensor that can be viewed as an image with multiple channels that can then be passed to further convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if the input consists of a grayscale image i.e. an image with only one channel and a $5\\times 5$ kernel is applied, the result is a single feature map. The borders of the input image are usuallz padded with zeros in order to ensure that the resulting feature maps has the same number of rows and columns as the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the input consists of a color image i.e. an image with three channels and a $5\\times 5$ kernel is applied, what will actually be applied is an $5\\times 5\\times 3$ kernel that will simultaneously process all three channels and the result will again be a single feature map. However, if e.g. 16 several kernels are applied, then the result will be 16 feature maps. Should they be passed to another convolutional layer, **each** of its kernels would simultaneously process **all** feature maps so their sizes would be e.g. $3\\times 3\\times 16$ or $5\\times 5\\times 16$ where 16 is used to reach all feature maps simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution is usually followed by applying an element-wise non-linear operation to each of the values in the feature maps. Finally, what offten follows is the summarization i.e. pooling of the information in the feature maps in order to reduce the spatial dimensions and keep only the more important information. A common approach used here is the so called max pooling. It is a non-linear downsampling where the input is divided into a set of non-overlapping rectangles and for each of them only the the maximum value inside of it is kept.\n",

    "<center>Figure 1. Max pooling with $2\\times 2$ rectangles (taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Max_pooling.png)).</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "What usually follows after several convolutional layers is putting the values of all feature maps into a single vector, which is then passed further to fully connected or other kinds of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of parameters in the convolutional depends on the number of feature maps and the sizes of the kernels. For example is a convolutional layer with 32 kernels of nominal size $3\\times 3$ receives 16 feature maps on its input, it will require $16\\times 3\\times 3\\times 32+32$ where the last 32 covers the kernel biases.\n",

    "## 8.1 The MNIST dataset revisited (2)\n",
    "In one of the previous exercises the MNIST dataset was used to demonstrate the use of multilayer perceptron. Here we are going to apply a convolutional neural network to the problem of digits classification. We will use the following layers to build our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [tf.nn.relu](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/relu)\n",

    "The [tf.layers.dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/dense) layer has the same effect as the fully connected layer matrix multiplication that was used in the previous exercise with the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Study and run the code below. How is the accuracy compared to the ones obtained in the previous exerises with MNIST?\n",

    "## 8.2 Image classification\n",
    "Image classification is a challenging computer vision problem with the best known competition being [The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/), which includes the ImageNet dataset with millions of $224\\times 224$ training images. The class names in one of the tasks there can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a). One of the most important breakthroughs was when in 2012 the convolutional neural network [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) won the first place. Ever since many highly successful convolutional neural networks architectures have been proposed, e.g. [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [VGG-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [ResNet](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf), [Inception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842), etc. Training such networks requires a lot of time because they have many layers with millions of parameters. In this exercise we are going to experiment with pre-trained models of some of the best known architectures. In order to make things simple, we are going to use [Keras](https://keras.io/), *\"a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.\"* To install Keras, it is enough to type\n",

After them there are layers that look for middle-level features such as circular objects, special curves, etc. Next, there are usually fully connected layers that create high-level semantic features by combining the information from the previous layers. These features are then used by the last layer that performs the actual classification. What we can do here is simply to discard the last layer i.e. not to calculate the class of an image, but to extract the values in on of the fully connected layers. This effectively means that we are going to use the network only as an extractor for high-level features that we would hardly be able to engineer on our own. Let's first see which layers can be found in the VGG-16 network:\n"
