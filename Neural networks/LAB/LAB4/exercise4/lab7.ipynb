    "# 7 Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "In this exercise we will try a simple experiment with a recurrent neural network. One of the well-known recurrent neural network models is the so called Long short-term memory (LSTM) network. More information on LSTM can be found in the text [Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",

    "## 7.1 The MNIST dataset revisited (1)\n",
    "In one of the previous exercises the MNIST dataset was used to demonstrate the use of multilayer perceptron. Here we are going to apply a recurrent neural network to the problem of digits classification. To keep it simple, we will use a simple LSTM network that will be fed with one row of the image at a time. With each new row, it will update its states and give its prediction. What we are interested in is its prediction after the last row i.e. after it has the full information."
